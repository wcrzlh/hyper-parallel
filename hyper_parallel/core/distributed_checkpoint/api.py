    :class:`multiprocessing.Process` that executes :func:`_save_impl` on the staged

    ``persist_completion``; it does not perform tensor work.

    Neither the thread nor the child process is a daemon, so a caller that exits with a
    checkpoint still in flight waits for it to land rather than losing it. Making only the
    thread a daemon would not shorten that wait either, since ``multiprocessing`` joins the
    non-daemon child at interpreter exit anyway; it would just drop ``persist_completion``

            load falls back to the rank-local one and turns this off by itself, so the default costs
            nothing to a checkpoint that cannot use it. What it does ask, as :func:`save` already
            does, is that **every rank of the default process group call this together**: the plan
            exchange runs on that group, so a rank that stays out of it leaves the others waiting on
            a gather that never completes. A rank with nothing to load still takes part, passing an
            empty state dict. Pass False to load on some of the ranks only.
        broadcast_replicated_tensors (bool): If True, a tensor that several ranks load identically is
            read by one of them and sent to the rest instead of every rank reading it. Which rank
            reads which tensor is chosen so that the reads spread evenly over the group. Default
            True, which divides what a load takes off storage by the number of ranks holding the
            same copy. Only consulted together with ``use_collectives``: without the plan exchange
            there is no way to tell which ranks load the same shard, so a load that asks for this
            without it quietly reads every copy instead, which is correct but no faster.
        broadcast_groups (dict): The Communication groups for broadcast, keyed by rank tuple.
            Only valid together with broadcast_replicated_tensors; built on demand when not given.
        broadcast_batch_bytes (int): Shards smaller than this are gathered into one buffer and
            broadcast together, so that the cost of starting a broadcast is paid once for many
            of them rather than once each. Larger shards are sent on their own. Zero turns the
            gathering off. Only consulted together with broadcast_replicated_tensors.
            Every rank must pass the same value: what a rank gathers together is worked
            out from this and from the plan, without asking anybody, so ranks that
            disagreed would broadcast in different shapes and wait on each other.
